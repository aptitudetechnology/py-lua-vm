You're right - that's the same error. The `_load_manifest()` method is trying to access `self.catalog` before it's been initialized. The fix I provided should resolve this by setting up `self.catalog` before calling `_load_manifest()`.

Let me make sure you have the complete fixed `__init__` method. Replace the entire `__init__` method in your `pylua_bioxen_vm_lib/utils/curator.py` file with this:

```python
def __init__(self, lua_path: str = None, manifest_path: str = None):
    """Initialize the curator with environment configuration"""
    # Set up logging FIRST
    self.logger = self._setup_logging()
    
    # Set up catalog BEFORE loading manifest (since _load_manifest uses it)
    self.catalog = {
        **self.CORE_PACKAGES,
        **self.NETWORKING_PACKAGES, 
        **self.PARSING_PACKAGES,
        **self.TESTING_PACKAGES
    }
    
    # NOW we can call methods that use the logger and catalog
    self.lua_path = lua_path or self._detect_lua_path()
    self.manifest_path = Path(manifest_path) if manifest_path else Path("manifest.json")
    
    # Load or create manifest (this needs self.catalog to exist)
    self.manifest = self._load_manifest()
```

The key change is moving the `self.catalog = {...}` **before** the `self.manifest = self._load_manifest()` call.

After making this change:

1. **Save the file**
2. **Reinstall**: `pip install -e .`
3. **Test**: `python3 interactive-bioxen-lua.py`

This should fix the AttributeError about 'catalog' not existing.
