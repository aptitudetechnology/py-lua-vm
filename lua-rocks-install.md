# LuaRocks Package Installation Plan for pylua_bioxen_vm_lib

## Objective
Enable users to install LuaRocks packages (with sudo privileges) into the VM environment, including recommended packages and any custom package.

---

## User Workflow
1. Present a list of recommended LuaRocks packages (e.g., `gabby-lua`).
2. Allow users to select from suggestions or enter any LuaRocks package name.
3. On selection, run `sudo luarocks install <package>` using Pythonâ€™s `subprocess`.
4. Log and display the installation result to the user.
5. Document the process and available packages in this file and the main README.

---

## Implementation Steps
1. **Add install method to VM classes:**
   - Add a method to `LuaProcess` and `NetworkedLuaVM` to install LuaRocks packages using subprocess and sudo.
2. **UI/CLI Integration:**
   - Update your CLI or UI to present package suggestions and accept custom input.
3. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle permission errors, installation failures, and log results.
4. **Documentation:**
   - Update this file and README with instructions and package recommendations.

## Example Python Function
```python
import subprocess

def install_luarocks_package(package_name):
    cmd = ["sudo", "luarocks", "install", package_name]
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(cmd, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        print("Install successful:", result.stdout)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Install failed:", e.stderr)
```

---

## Files to Update
- `pylua_vm/lua_process.py` (add install method)
- `pylua_vm/networking.py` (add install method)
- Any CLI/UI scripts that present package options and trigger installation
- `README.md` (document LuaRocks installation workflow)

---

## Recommended Packages
- `gabby-lua`
- (Add more as needed for your environment)

---

This plan enables privileged LuaRocks package installation and user-driven package management for your VM environment.
