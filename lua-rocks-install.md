# PyLua VM Project - Session Continuation

## Project Overview
We are developing an intelligent Lua VM management system with a focus on AGI bootstrapping through sophisticated package curation. The system uses a "curator" approach - embodying intelligence, discernment, and long-term vision for building foundational systems that enable higher-level capabilities to emerge.

## Core Philosophy
The curator embodies the intelligence needed for AGI development:
- **Discernment**: Carefully selects which packages/knowledge to include
- **Context awareness**: Understands how different components work together
- **Quality control**: Ensures only valuable, reliable additions make it in
- **Long-term vision**: Builds collections that grow more valuable over time
- **Adaptive expertise**: Learns what works and refines the selection process

## Integration Usage Examples

```python
# Environment-aware VM setup
from pylua_vm.env import EnvironmentManager
from pylua_vm.lua_process import LuaProcess
from pylua_vm.networking import NetworkedLuaVM

# 1. Environment Setup
env = EnvironmentManager(profile='full', debug_mode=True)
errors = env.validate_environment()
if errors:
    print("Environment issues:", errors)

# 2. VM Creation with Environment Integration
vm = LuaProcess(
    name=f"AGI-{env.profile.title()}",
    lua_executable=env.lua_executable,
    debug_mode=env.debug_mode
)

# 3. Curator Package Setup
result = vm.setup_packages(env.profile)
print(f"Packages installed: {len(result['packages_installed'])}")

# 4. Networking VM with Automatic Package Management
net_vm = NetworkedLuaVM(name="AGI-Network", debug_mode=True)
net_result = net_vm.setup_networking_packages(include_advanced=True)
print(f"Networking ready: {net_result['networking_ready']}")

# 5. Health Monitoring
health = net_vm.check_networking_health()
print(f"Network readiness: {health['networking']['networking_readiness_percentage']}%")

# 6. Intelligent Recommendations
recommendations = net_vm.get_networking_recommendations()
for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"Category: {rec['networking_category']} - {rec['package']}")
```

## Development Priorities for Next Session

1. **CREATE INTEGRATION EXAMPLES** - Demonstrate all components working together
2. **CREATE TEST SCRIPT** - Comprehensive testing of integrated functionality
3. **Enhance Logging** - Unified logging across all components
4. **CLI Interface** - Command-line tools for easy management
5. **Documentation** - User guides and API documentation

## Key Questions to Address in Examples/Tests

1. How do all three systems (Environment + VM + Curator) work together in real workflows?
2. What happens when Lua/LuaRocks is missing? How does error handling work?
3. How does profile switching affect already-installed packages?
4. What's the complete workflow from fresh install to running networked VMs?
5. How do the health monitoring systems provide actionable feedback?
6. What are the performance characteristics of package installation?

## Notes for Next Session

- **Focus on integration examples first** - This will validate our architecture
- **Create comprehensive test script** - Essential for ongoing development
- All three major components are complete and ready for integration testing
- The system is designed for extensibility - new profiles, package sources, and features can be added easily
