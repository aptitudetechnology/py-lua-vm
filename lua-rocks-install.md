Excellent! Here are the detailed refinements to enhance your LuaRocks package management system:

## Enhanced Refinements

### 1. **Version Pinning Support**
- Add optional version parameter to installation functions
- Support semantic versioning constraints (e.g., ">=1.0.0", "~>2.1")
- Store version requirements in a manifest file for reproducible environments
- Include version validation before installation

### 2. **Package Removal & Cleanup**
- `remove_luarocks_package(package_name)` function
- `cleanup_orphaned_packages()` to remove unused dependencies
- `list_installed_packages()` with version info
- Backup/restore functionality for package states

### 3. **Enhanced Pre-installation Checks**
- Check if specific version is already installed (not just package existence)
- Dependency conflict detection before installation
- Disk space verification for large packages
- LuaRocks configuration validation

### 4. **Local Development Support**
- `install_from_rockspec(path_to_rockspec)` for local development
- `install_from_git(repo_url, branch/tag)` for development versions
- Support for local rock repositories
- Development vs production package profiles

### 5. **Improved Package List**
```
Recommended packages with categories:
- Core utilities: lua-cjson, luafilesystem, penlight
- Networking: luasocket, http (if available)
- Parsing: lpeg, lua-parser
- Testing: busted, luassert
- Development: inspect, lustache
- Performance: lua-resty-* packages (if OpenResty context)
```

### 6. **Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Network timeout handling for slow connections
- Partial installation recovery (cleanup on failure)
- Detailed error categorization (network, permissions, dependencies)

### 7. **Environment Management**
- Package environment isolation (if using multiple Lua versions)
- Configuration profiles for different deployment scenarios
- Environment variable validation and setup
- Cross-platform path handling improvements

### 8. **Advanced Logging & Monitoring**
- Installation progress tracking with percentages
- Package usage analytics (optional)
- Installation history with rollback capabilities
- Performance metrics for installation times

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these refinements, or shall we discuss implementation priorities?
