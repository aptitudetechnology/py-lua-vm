# PyLua VM Project - Session Continuation

## Project Overview
We are developing an intelligent Lua VM management system with a focus on AGI bootstrapping through sophisticated package curation. The system uses a "curator" approach - embodying intelligence, discernment, and long-term vision for building foundational systems that enable higher-level capabilities to emerge.

## Core Philosophy
The curator embodies the intelligence needed for AGI development:
- **Discernment**: Carefully selects which packages/knowledge to include
- **Context awareness**: Understands how different components work together
- **Quality control**: Ensures only valuable, reliable additions make it in
- **Long-term vision**: Builds collections that grow more valuable over time
- **Adaptive expertise**: Learns what works and refines the selection process

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

#### Core Utilities
- **`pylua_vm/utils/curator.py`** - Intelligent package management system with:
  - Curated package collections (core, networking, parsing, testing)
  - Environment profiles (minimal, standard, full)
  - Version pinning and semantic versioning support
  - Dependency resolution and conflict detection
  - Manifest-based reproducible environments
  - Health monitoring and diagnostics
  - Intelligent recommendations based on current setup
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling

- **`pylua_vm/utils/__init__.py`** - Package initialization with clean public API:
  - Exposes main classes and functions
  - Convenience aliases for common operations
  - Version and authorship metadata

### 🔄 Next Implementation Steps

#### 1. VM Class Integration (High Priority)
Update existing VM classes to use the curator system:

**Files to update:**
- `pylua_vm/lua_process.py` - Add curator integration methods
- `pylua_vm/networking.py` - Add curator integration methods

**Required methods to add:**
```python
def setup_packages(self, profile='standard'):
    """Setup packages using curator"""
    
def install_package(self, package_name, version='latest'):
    """Install specific package via curator"""
    
def get_package_recommendations(self):
    """Get curator recommendations"""
    
def check_environment_health(self):
    """Check system health via curator"""
```

#### 2. Environment Management (Medium Priority)
**File to create:** `pylua_vm/env.py`
- Environment profile management
- Configuration validation
- Cross-platform path handling
- Development vs production profiles

#### 3. Enhanced Logging System (Medium Priority)
**File to update:** `pylua_vm/logger.py` (if exists) or create new
- Integration with curator logging
- Progress tracking for installations
- Installation history for rollback capabilities
- Performance metrics

#### 4. CLI Integration (Low Priority)
**Files to update/create:**
- `pylua_vm/cli.py` or `pylua_vm/install.py`
- Interactive package selection interface
- Command-line package management tools

#### 5. Documentation Updates (Low Priority)
**Files to update:**
- `README.md` - Document new curator functionality
- `lua-rocks-install.md` - Update with implementation details

## Key Features Implemented

### Curator Package Management
- **Curated Collections**: Pre-selected packages organized by category and priority
- **Environment Profiles**: Minimal, standard, and full configurations
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with constraint parsing
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic dependency installation
- **Health Monitoring**: System diagnostics and package validation
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Context-aware package suggestions
- **Manifest System**: Reproducible environment configurations

### Package Categories
- **Core**: lua-cjson, luafilesystem, penlight, inspect
- **Networking**: luasocket, http
- **Parsing**: lpeg, lua-parser  
- **Testing**: busted, luassert

## Usage Examples

```python
# Quick environment setup
from pylua_vm.utils import setup_environment
setup_environment('standard')  # or 'minimal', 'full'

# Manual package management
from pylua_vm.utils import Curator
curator = Curator()
curator.install_package('lua-cjson')
curator.curate_environment('full')

# Health checking
health = curator.health_check()
recommendations = curator.get_recommendations()
```

## Development Priorities

1. **VM Integration** - Connect curator to existing VM classes
2. **Environment Management** - Robust configuration system  
3. **Testing** - Comprehensive test suite for curator functionality
4. **Documentation** - User guides and API documentation
5. **Advanced Features** - Git installation, local development support

## Notes for Next Session

- Focus on VM class integration first for immediate value
- The curator system is designed for extensibility - new package sources and curation algorithms can be added easily
- All logging goes to `logs/` directory with date-based rotation
- Manifest file tracks all installation history for reproducibility
- System is designed around the philosophy of intelligent curation rather than simple package management

## Questions to Address

1. Should we add automatic dependency cleanup when removing packages?
2. How should we handle conflicts between different environment profiles?
3. Should we implement package usage analytics for better recommendations?
4. What level of LuaRocks integration testing do we need?
