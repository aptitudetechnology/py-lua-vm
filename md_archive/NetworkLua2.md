# NetworkedLuaVM Debug Mode Integration: Error Analysis & Solution

## Error Summary

- The `NetworkedLuaVM` class in `networking.py` does not accept a `debug_mode` parameter in its constructor, but the codebase passes `debug_mode` when instantiating it.
- The constructor tries to use `debug_mode` (for `super().__init__` and `VMLogger`), but since it is not defined, this causes a `TypeError` and `AttributeError`.

## Root Cause

- The `__init__` method signature for `NetworkedLuaVM` is missing `debug_mode: bool = False`.
- The code attempts to use `debug_mode` inside the constructor, but it is not available in the local scope.

## Solution

Update the `NetworkedLuaVM` constructor to:
```python
def __init__(self, name: str = "NetworkedLuaVM", lua_executable: str = "lua", debug_mode: bool = False):
    super().__init__(name=name, lua_executable=lua_executable, debug_mode=debug_mode)
    self.logger = VMLogger(debug_mode=debug_mode, component="NetworkedLuaVM")
    self._verify_luasocket()
```

## Next Steps
- Apply the fix to `pylua_vm/networking.py`.
- Retest networked VM creation and cleanup to confirm the error is resolved.
- Ensure all VM types consistently support `debug_mode` and logger integration.

This report documents the constructor error and the required fix for proper debug mode and logger support in `NetworkedLuaVM`.
