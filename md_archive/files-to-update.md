# Files to Update for Enhanced LuaRocks Package Management

Based on the advanced plan in `lua-rocks-install.md`, the following files should be created or updated:

---

## Core Utilities
- `pylua_vm/utils/luarocks.py`  
  (Shared utility for install, remove, list, version pinning, error handling, etc.)

## VM Classes
- `pylua_vm/lua_process.py`  
  (Integrate install/remove/list methods, delegate to utility)
- `pylua_vm/networking.py`  
  (Integrate install/remove/list methods, delegate to utility)

## Environment & Manifest
- `pylua_vm/env.py`  
  (Environment management, profiles, variable validation)
- `pylua_vm/manifest.json` or `.rockspec`  
  (Store version requirements, reproducible installs)

## Logging & Monitoring
- `pylua_vm/logger.py`  
  (Advanced logging, progress tracking, analytics)
- `logs/` folder  
  (Store installation logs, history, rollback info)

## CLI & UI Integration
- `pylua_vm/cli.py` or `pylua_vm/install.py`  
  (Interactive/non-interactive package selection, install triggers)
- Any UI scripts or menu systems that present package options

## Documentation
- `README.md`  
  (Document all new features, workflows, and usage)
- `lua-rocks-install.md`  
  (Keep updated with implementation details and refinements)
