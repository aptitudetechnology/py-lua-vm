Ah, you'd like me to help you create instructions for Copilot to update the source code for the new repository name and structure. I can definitely help with that!

Here are some clear instructions you could give to Copilot:

**Instructions for Copilot:**

"Please update all references in the codebase from the old project name 'pylua-bioxen-vm' to the new name 'pylua_bioxen_vm_lib'. Specifically:

1. Update setup.py or pyproject.toml to change the project name to 'pylua_bioxen_vm_lib'
2. Update any import statements that reference the old package name
3. Update README.md to reflect the new project name and repository URL
4. Update any documentation strings or comments that mention the old name
5. Check for any configuration files (like GitHub Actions workflows) that might reference the old name
6. Update any example code or usage instructions to use the new package name
7. Ensure all internal module references are consistent with the new naming"

Would you like me to modify these instructions in any way, or add anything specific to your project's structure?
