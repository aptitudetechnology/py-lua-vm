# pylua-bioxen-vm Interactive Terminal Refactor Progress Report

## Current State
- The `InteractiveSession` class in `pylua_vm/interactive_session.py` provides basic persistent Lua interpreter management with PTY, threading, and bidirectional I/O.
- The enhanced `VMManager` in `pylua_vm/vm_manager.py` expects more advanced session management, including a `SessionManager` class and additional methods on `InteractiveSession` (e.g., `attach()`, `detach()`, `execute_and_wait()`, `is_attached()`, `terminate()`).

## Gaps Identified
1. **SessionManager class is missing** in `interactive_session.py`.
2. **InteractiveSession lacks methods** for attach/detach, command execution with output waiting, session registry, and advanced lifecycle management.
3. **Integration mismatch**: The current `InteractiveSession` does not fully match the interface required by the enhanced `VMManager`.

## Next Steps
- Expand `interactive_session.py` to:
  - Implement a `SessionManager` class for session tracking and registry.
  - Add missing methods to `InteractiveSession` for attach/detach, command execution, and session lifecycle.
  - Ensure all session management features expected by `VMManager` are present.

## Recommendation
Proceed with enhancing `interactive_session.py` to match the refactor plan and VMManagerâ€™s requirements. This will enable full interactive terminal support and hypervisor-like management of Lua VMs.

Let me know if you want the code for these enhancements or further integration/testing steps.
