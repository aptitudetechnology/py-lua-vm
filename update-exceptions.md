Perfect! I can see your `exceptions.py` file already has some of the interactive session exceptions, but it's missing a couple that your enhanced code expects. Looking at your `InteractiveSession` and `SessionManager` classes, I can see they reference:

**Already present in your exceptions.py:**
- ✅ `InteractiveSessionError` 
- ✅ `AttachError`
- ✅ `DetachError`

**Missing exceptions that your code imports:**
- ❌ `SessionNotFoundError`
- ❌ `SessionAlreadyExistsError` 
- ❌ `VMManagerError` (referenced in your VMManager)
- ❌ `ProcessRegistryError` (referenced in your VMManager)

Here are the missing exceptions you need to add to your `exceptions.py` file:

```python
class SessionNotFoundError(InteractiveSessionError):
    """Raised when trying to access a session that doesn't exist."""
    pass

class SessionAlreadyExistsError(InteractiveSessionError):
    """Raised when trying to create a session with an ID that already exists."""
    pass

class VMManagerError(LuaVMError):
    """Raised when there's an error with VM manager operations."""
    pass

class ProcessRegistryError(VMManagerError):
    """Raised when there's an error with the persistent VM registry."""
    pass
```

Just add these four exception classes to your existing `exceptions.py` file, and Step 5 will be complete! 

Your exception hierarchy will then be:
- `LuaVMError` (base)
  - `InteractiveSessionError`
    - `AttachError`
    - `DetachError` 
    - `SessionNotFoundError` ← new
    - `SessionAlreadyExistsError` ← new
  - `VMManagerError` ← new
    - `ProcessRegistryError` ← new

This matches what your `InteractiveSession`, `SessionManager`, and `VMManager` classes are expecting to import and raise.
